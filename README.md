# Morse-Code-Teaching-Device
The Morse Code Teaching Device is the ultimate tool to learn Morse Code. Through constant testing and repetition, the MCTD teaches users the three core parts of morse code:
1. Reading "written" morse code
2. Listening to "auditory" morse code
3. "Writing" morse code using dits and dahs.
